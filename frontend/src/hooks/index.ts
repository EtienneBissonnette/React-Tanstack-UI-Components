/**
 * Global Hooks
 *
 * This folder contains truly global/reusable utility hooks that are not
 * tied to any specific component or feature.
 *
 * Examples of hooks that belong here:
 * - useLocalStorage
 * - useMediaQuery
 * - useDebounce
 * - useClickOutside
 *
 * Component-specific hooks live with their components:
 * - useDataTable → @/components/ui/DataTable
 * - useOverlay → @/components/ui/Overlay
 *
 * Context hooks live with their context:
 * - useTheme → @/context
 */

// Export global utility hooks here as they are created
// Example: export { useLocalStorage } from './useLocalStorage';
